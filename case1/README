in this testcase, there are 6 datasets, 2 conditions, and very few kmers in total.
One of the kmers is found only in condition B (in all samples), 
and another is found differentially between both conditions;
all the other kmers are found in exactly the same number of times in both conditions


Dependencies:
Requires dekupl-run, wgs branch, to be somewhere on your system.
From now on, we will assume it's in ~/dekupl-run.
Also requires that dekupl-run has been compiled (i.e. been run once)
and is working.
To test this, go to your dekupl-run folder and type 'snakemake', 
it will run the default test.

To run this testcase, type:

snakemake --snakefile ~/dekupl-run/Snakefile
